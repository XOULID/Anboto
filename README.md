Anboto is proudly developed with the U++ framework using the C++ language. U++ makes C++ so simple and efficient that it appeals even to scripting language programmers. 

Anboto adds multiple additional features to U++ so that your projects can be developed faster.

## Libraries included
### General use
* Functions4U

## Install
* Go to U++ folder (normally 'upp') and open uppsrc.var with a text editor like Notepad. You will get something like:
<pre>
UPP = "%U++ParentFolder$/upp/uppsrc";
OUTPUT = "%U++ParentFolder$/upp/out";

* Replace content of "UPP = ..." line with:
<pre>UPP = "%AnbotoParentFolder$/Anboto;%U++ParentFolder$/upp/uppsrc;%U++ParentFolder$/upp/bazaar";
* Save the file as 'Anboto.var'

From now on you will have 'Anboto' ready to be selected in the 'Select main package' dialog.
